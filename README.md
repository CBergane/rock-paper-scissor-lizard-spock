## User Experience UX

### Project Goals

* This website is a simple and short fun game of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" but with added two more choices.
* You play against the game itself with 5 choices, first to 10 wins will take home the victory.


### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme image](assets/readme/colors.jpeg)

I chose these colors to make a feel like a retro game.

### Typography

For the font, I went for Barlow Semi Condensed, since it felt a bit retro as well and a fallback of Sans-Serif if Barlow isn't loaded correctly.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) was used to build the wireframes to showcase the elements of the site.

    - The game container has a quick explanation of the game and the win conditions for the game.
    - Under that, the counter for both the player and the game is displayed.
    - After the scoreboard, there are the player choices for the game, five buttons whit a hover effect on them to make sure the player makes the intended decision.

## Testing

* When you arrive at the game I want as little confusion as possible for the player. Just start and go.
* If you want to have a look at the rules of the game there is a button to explain them to you.
* The score is visual for the player and what you need to do to win the game.
* The choices buttons clearly with a font awesome icon that explains what the choice will be.

### Code Validation

* The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator), * [jshint](https://jshint.com) were used to validate the site.

    - The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) found no errors in my HTML, but two warnings were found but I disregarded them since I used a list to make the main logo.
