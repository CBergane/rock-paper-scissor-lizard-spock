## User Experience UX

### Project Goals

* This website is a simple and short fun game of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" but with added two more choices.
* You play against the game itself with 5 choices, first to 10 wins will take home the victory.


### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme image](assets/readme/colors.jpeg)

I chose these colors to make a feel like a retro game.

### Typography

For the font, I went for Barlow Semi Condensed, since it felt a bit retro as well and a fallback of Sans-Serif if Barlow isn't loaded correctly.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) was used to build the wireframes to showcase the elements of the site.
